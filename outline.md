**Plush, moist, fluffy crumb** _without_ being freakishly unnaturally so (as some store bought can be). No more dense cakes!

Keeps near perfectly for 4 whole days. **100% fresh on Day 1**, still 96% perfect on Day 4. That’s unheard of!

Lovely **_vanilla and butter flavour_** without a greasy mouthfeel;

Even, elegant crumb – no large tunnels or irregular, crumbly holes;

Bakes perfectly flat – no levelling required!

> Makes perfect cupcakes;

>> Not overly sweet; and

As tender as it can be but still be stable enough to make a large layered cake smothered with frosting or piles of cream and berries. In contrast, Chiffon Cakes and Japanese Sponges which, while lighter still, cannot actually hold up to much extra weight – the bottom layer gets quite squished.
